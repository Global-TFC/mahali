# House Component Design Changes

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created HouseModal Component
- Created a new `HouseModal.jsx` component similar to `AreaModal.jsx`
- Implemented form with all required fields for house creation/editing
- Added area selection dropdown with dynamic loading of areas
- Integrated with houseAPI for create/update operations
- Added proper error/success handling

### 2. Updated Houses Component
- Replaced inline form approach with modal-based UI
- Added React Icons for better visual consistency:
  - House icon before "Houses" heading
  - Plus icon for "Add New House" button
  - Refresh icon for reload button
  - Edit and Delete icons for action buttons
- Implemented proper state management for modals
- Added confirmation dialog for delete operations
- Added data reload functionality

### 3. Updated App Component
- Modified Houses component usage to pass loadDataForTab function
- Ensured proper data refresh after CRUD operations

### 4. Auto-generation of home_id
- The backend automatically generates home_id starting from 1001
- The frontend no longer needs to handle home_id input
- Backend logic ensures sequential IDs based on existing data
